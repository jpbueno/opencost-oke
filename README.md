# Manage Your Multi-tenant SaaS Costs on OCI OKE with OpenCost: A Guide for ISV Customers

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) providing multi-tenant SaaS solutions on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) face the challenge of managing costs effectively while ensuring each tenant is billed accurately. Running Kubernetes clusters on Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) offers scalability, but without the right tools, cost allocation can be complex, especially when tenants share the same infrastructure.

In this guide, we will walk you through an easy-to-deploy solution using **OpenCost**, an open-source cost monitoring tool that helps ISVs track and manage costs for their tenants in a multi-tenant SaaS environment on OCI OKE. We will focus on a real-world example where tenants are separated by Kubernetes namespaces, along with how to configure custom pricing for OCI resources.

## Why ISVs Need to Manage Costs for Multi-tenant SaaS Applications

As an ISV, you're likely running SaaS applications where multiple tenants share infrastructure in an OKE cluster. The challenge lies in understanding which tenant is consuming which resources—like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth—so that you can allocate costs accurately.

If you don't have visibility into resource usage per tenant, it becomes hard to:
- **Accurately bill tenants** for their resource usage.
- **Optimize resources** to avoid over-provisioning.
- **Control costs**, ensuring profitability for your SaaS business.

## What is OpenCost?

**OpenCost** is an open-source cost monitoring and management tool designed specifically for Kubernetes environments. It tracks the resource usage of your OKE clusters and allocates the costs for CPU, memory, storage, and networking. OpenCost allows you to easily map these costs to your tenants based on Kubernetes namespaces, making it an ideal solution for ISVs with multi-tenant SaaS applications.

With OpenCost, you can:
1. **Allocate costs by namespace** (or label) to track individual tenant usage.
2. **Monitor resource consumption** (CPU, memory, network) for each tenant in real-time.
3. **Optimize resources** to ensure efficient use of compute and storage.
4. **Integrate with your billing system** to automate tenant billing based on actual usage.

## Deploying OpenCost on OCI OKE for Multi-tenant SaaS Applications

Let’s go through the steps to set up OpenCost on your OKE cluster and configure it to manage costs based on Kubernetes namespaces, where each namespace corresponds to a different tenant.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:
- An active **OKE** cluster in **OCI**.
- **kubectl** installed and configured to access your OKE cluster.
- **Helm** installed to manage your Kubernetes packages.

### Step 2: Install OpenCost on Your OKE Cluster

To deploy OpenCost, use Helm to simplify the installation process. Here's how to install OpenCost:

```bash
helm repo add opencost https://opencost.github.io/opencost-helm-chart
