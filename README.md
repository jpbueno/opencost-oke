**Manage Multi-tenant SaaS Costs on OCI OKE with OpenCost**

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) providing multi-tenant SaaS solutions on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) face the challenge of managing costs effectively while ensuring each tenant is billed accurately. Running Kubernetes clusters on Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) offers scalability, but without the right tools, cost allocation can be complex, especially when tenants share the same infrastructure.

In this guide, we will walk you through an easy-to-deploy solution using **OpenCost**, an open-source cost monitoring tool that helps ISVs track and manage costs for their tenants in a multi-tenant SaaS environment on OCI OKE. We will focus on a real-world example where tenants are separated by Kubernetes namespaces, along with how to configure custom pricing for OCI resources.

**Why ISVs Need to Manage Costs for Multi-tenant SaaS Applications**

As an ISV, you're likely running SaaS applications where multiple tenants share infrastructure in an OKE cluster. The challenge lies in understanding which tenant is consuming which resources—like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth—so that you can allocate costs accurately.

If you don't have visibility into resource usage per tenant, it becomes hard to:

- **Accurately bill tenants** for their resource usage.
- **Optimize resources** to avoid over-provisioning.
- **Control costs**, ensuring profitability for your SaaS business.

**What is OpenCost?**

**OpenCost** is an open-source cost monitoring and management tool designed specifically for Kubernetes environments. It tracks the resource usage of your OKE clusters and allocates the costs for CPU, memory, storage, and networking. OpenCost allows you to easily map these costs to your tenants based on Kubernetes namespaces, making it an ideal solution for ISVs with multi-tenant SaaS applications.

With OpenCost, you can:

1. **Allocate costs by namespace** (or label) to track individual tenant usage.
2. **Monitor resource consumption** (CPU, memory, network) for each tenant in real-time.
3. **Optimize resources** to ensure efficient use of compute and storage.
4. **Integrate with your billing system** to automate tenant billing based on actual usage.

**Deploying OpenCost on OCI OKE for Multi-tenant SaaS Applications**

Let’s go through the steps to set up OpenCost on your OKE cluster and configure it to manage costs based on Kubernetes namespaces, where each namespace corresponds to a different tenant.

**Step 1: Prerequisites**

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- An active **OKE** cluster in **OCI**.
- **kubectl** installed and configured to access your OKE cluster.
- **Helm** installed to manage your Kubernetes packages.

**Step 2: Install OpenCost on Your OKE Cluster**

To deploy OpenCost, use Helm to simplify the installation process. Here's how to install OpenCost:

1. Add the OpenCost Helm repository:

helm repo add opencost <https://opencost.github.io/opencost-helm-chart>

1. Update the repository:

helm repo update

1. Install OpenCost into the kube-system namespace:

helm install opencost opencost/opencost --namespace kube-system

After installation, OpenCost will begin tracking resource usage across all namespaces in your OKE cluster.

**Step 3: Configure OpenCost for Multi-tenant Cost Allocation**

To allocate costs per tenant, ensure that each tenant is assigned a unique Kubernetes namespace. OpenCost will automatically group costs based on the namespace, allowing you to track the resources consumed by each tenant.

Let’s assume your tenants are organized like this:

- tenant-a: Namespace for Tenant A.
- tenant-b: Namespace for Tenant B.
- tenant-c: Namespace for Tenant C.

In OpenCost, configure cost allocation by enabling namespace tracking:

allocation:

tenantNamespace: true # Allocate costs by namespace (one per tenant)

This ensures OpenCost allocates CPU, memory, and storage costs based on the usage within each tenant's namespace.

**Setting Up Custom Pricing in OpenCost for OCI Resources**

When running your workloads on OCI, you’ll want to ensure that OpenCost accurately reflects OCI’s resource pricing. OpenCost’s **Custom Pricing** feature allows you to define the exact pricing for CPU, memory, and storage, ensuring that your cost reports are aligned with OCI’s pricing model.

**Step 1: Create a Custom Pricing JSON File**

First, you need to define the pricing for your OCI resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage. You can do this by creating a custom pricing JSON file.

Here is an example of what the custom pricing file might look like:

{

"CPU": {

"cost": "0.025" // Cost per vCPU hour in USD

},

"memory": {

"cost": "0.003" // Cost per GB hour in USD

},

"storage": {

"cost": "0.0001" // Cost per GB hour in USD

}

}

Replace the pricing values with the current OCI pricing for the specific regions or compute shapes you are using.

Save this file as custom-pricing.json.

**Step 2: Set Up the Custom Pricing in the OpenCost Deployment**

To make OpenCost use your custom pricing file, you need to set the CUSTOM_PRICING_CONFIG environment variable to point to the location of the JSON file. You’ll do this by modifying the OpenCost deployment YAML file.

Add the following section under the environment variables (env) in your OpenCost deployment YAML:

apiVersion: apps/v1

kind: Deployment

metadata:

name: opencost

namespace: kube-system

spec:

template:

spec:

containers:

\- name: opencost

image: opencost/opencost:latest

env:

\- name: CUSTOM_PRICING_CONFIG

value: "/config/custom-pricing.json" # Path to your custom pricing file

volumeMounts:

\- name: custom-pricing

mountPath: /config # Mount the volume for custom pricing

volumes:

\- name: custom-pricing

configMap:

name: custom-pricing-config # Assuming you create a ConfigMap for custom pricing

Here’s how to create a ConfigMap with the custom pricing information:

kubectl create configmap custom-pricing-config --from-file=custom-pricing.json -n kube-system

This will ensure that OpenCost pulls the correct pricing for OCI resources, allowing you to allocate costs accurately based on OCI's compute and storage pricing.

**Step 3: Verify Custom Pricing**

Once the deployment is updated, OpenCost will begin using the new pricing information to calculate costs. You can verify that the custom pricing is applied correctly by reviewing OpenCost's output in your monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana. The cost data should now reflect the pricing specified in your custom-pricing.json file.

**Cost Optimization Strategies for ISVs**

After setting up OpenCost and tracking tenant usage, here are some optimization strategies you can implement:

1. **Right-size Resource Allocations**: OpenCost will show you if any tenants are over-provisioned (using too much CPU or memory for their workload). You can use this information to adjust the resource limits for each tenant's pods, ensuring you’re not paying for unused capacity.
2. **Leverage OCI's Flexible Compute Pricing**: OCI offers preemptible instances that can reduce costs significantly. Non-critical workloads for specific tenants can be shifted to these instances, offering savings.
3. **Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**: Kubernetes’ Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) can automatically scale the number of pods per tenant based on resource usage. This ensures that you only pay for the resources that are actively being used.
4. **Monitor Network Egress**: OpenCost can help you track network costs for each tenant. By analyzing network traffic, you can identify potential optimizations, such as reducing cross-region traffic or using OCI’s advanced networking features to minimize costs.

**Conclusion**

By integrating OpenCost with your OCI OKE cluster and configuring custom pricing, you can gain precise visibility into your multi-tenant SaaS costs. ISVs can now allocate costs fairly and accurately, ensuring that each tenant's resource usage is reflected in the final bill.

With the custom pricing feature of OpenCost, you ensure that the cost estimates align with OCI’s pricing, which is critical for maintaining profitability in a multi-tenant SaaS environment.
